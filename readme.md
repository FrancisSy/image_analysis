Hi, this is the readme file.

This is a program that finds subset images from original images found inside a folder or directory.
This program is written in the Python Programming Language.
It was written in the Python version 3.6. It currently only supports .jpg files.


To get this program to run, you will need to install the PILLOW (PIL Fork) Library. You can install PILLOW at this link: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
